🎄 Advent of Code Solutions in Rust 🦀
Welcome to my Advent of Code solutions repository! This repo contains my implementations of the Advent of Code puzzles using the Rust programming language. Advent of Code is a fun and educational way to challenge yourself with daily programming puzzles during December.

🧩 About Advent of Code
Advent of Code is an annual event featuring a series of holiday-themed programming puzzles that are released every day from December 1st to 25th. The puzzles range in difficulty, testing your problem-solving skills while introducing unique algorithmic challenges.

💻 Why Rust?
Rust's focus on performance, safety, and expressiveness makes it an excellent language for tackling Advent of Code challenges. It's also a great way to deepen my understanding of Rust and its ecosystem.
